Russ Alan Prince & Hannah Shaw Grove, in their landmark study on the Family Office industry, surveyed 653 single family, multi-family and commercial-family offices in the United States and found that these Family Offices serve 34,499 clients collectively.  These Family Offices represent more than $2.1 trillion in combined net worth with another $1.2 trillion in investable assets.

The exceptionally wealthy are identified as having estates worth at least $10 million.  Prince & Groveâ€™s best estimate is that there are 1,104,000 families with $10 million or more in total assets.

Surveyed family offices estimate there are 3,000 to 4,000 single and multi-family offices in the U.S. and 2,000 to 3,000 more worldwide.

The following charts reflect these trends illustrated by Prince and Grove:

In 2004, Prince and Grove estimated that the number of affluent families with $10 million or more would increase from 2.2 million by 2015. Those families were anticipated to control $154.4 trillion, up from $91.7 trillion in 2004.
