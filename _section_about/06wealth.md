We believe there are Ten Best Practices which should be used in helping our families preserve their wealth to and beyond these five generations:

1. **BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND:**  The Affinity Family by Stephen R. Covey.
2. **SHIFT THE FAMILY'S WEALTH PARADIGM:** Family Wealth is in its human assets. Wealth in Families by C.Collier.
3. **PHILANTHROPY:** Create a common cause  and outward  focus through a tradition of service and philanthropy.
4. **FAMILY BANK:** Increase responsibility and accountability creating a connection between wealth and responsiblity.
5. **FINANCIAL MORALITY:**  Helping every generation be a “First Generation “Wealth” Builder.” Defining “wealth” in the broadest sense.
6. **COHESIVENESS:**  Hold regular, organized and purposeful Family Activities and projects that help to elevate the family.
7. **COLLABORATION:**  Create a shared dream through a Family Philosophy and Vision Statement. Create a plan of action.
8. **PROPERTY PLUS:** Control wealth where there is control without ownership.
9. **ACTIVE MANAGEMENT:** Understand that Wealth Management is a dynamic, continuous, and opportunistic process.
10. **GOVERNANCE:** Developing leadership and maintain centralized management and governance through a Family Office or participation in a Multi-Family Office.
								
Our approach to wealth management is centered on the philosophy that families must break the three-generation cycle of wealth dissipation and replace it with a wealth management system that will preserve a family’s wealth well beyond five generations.
