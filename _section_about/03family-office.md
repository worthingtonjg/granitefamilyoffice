For generations, select families of exceptional wealth established family offices as a means of guiding, shaping and managing the assets that they had amassed.

> <i>The family office stands at the apex of the world’s wealth pyramid, attending to the every financial and personal need of the ultra-affluent</i>

These offices were built upon the knowledge that maintaining wealth from one generation to the next required two things:

- The proximity of highly skilled professionals focused on the family's unique financial requirements and,
- The ability of the family to retain ultimate decision-making authority.
- The organization to create seamless transition from generation to generation.

There are three types of Family Offices:
  
- <b>Single member Family Offices</b> where there is only one family being served;
- <b>Multi-member Family Offices</b> which often have at least one anchor family
- <b>Commercial Family Offices</b> which are often served through banks and other financial services and where there is generally no anchor family.

Prestigious Wealth Management Firms resulted from Family Offices.  Wealthy industrialists entered into banking and trust companies:

- The Morgan Family is best known with JP Morgan Bank, Morgan Trust, Morgan Stanley.
- The Rockefeller family created Chase Manhattan and then Rockefeller and Company.
- Carnegie’s partner, the Phipps family, created the Bessemer Trust.
- Philadelphia’s Pew family created the Glenmede Trust Company.

We are a multi-member Family Office serving both anchor (exceptionally wealthy) and non-anchor (wealthy) families.
