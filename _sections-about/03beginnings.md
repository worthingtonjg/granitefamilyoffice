Family Office ® was established in 1988 to make the benefits of the family office concept available to a broader range of individuals and families. We provide these benefits to families and individuals, such as heirs and career professionals who are often too busy to handle the day-to-day demands of financial management.

<i>Family Office ® was founded in 1988 and today serves clients all over the United States.</i>

Our original role was to coordinate a broad range of integrated financial services, including investment and trust management, tax and estate planning, accounting, property management, bill paying and insurance administration.

In order to expand on this core service, Family Office ® USA was established in 2007. We are now able to provide an enhanced level of the Individual Family Office to select clients. Each Family Office is tailor made to meet the client’s personal and family needs from multiple perspectives, whether it is philanthropic support, medical health needs, integrated trust administration and investment advisory services or sophisticated estate planning.
