Many of the larger financial institutions are downsizing the workforce and decreasing the level of personal service provided to Trust and Investment customers as a cost saving measure.

Maintaining “high touch” personal relationships is not as important to many in the American financial advisory system as it once was.

<i>“High touch” personal relationships are our hallmark</i>

Personalized care delivered by “local” Trust or Investment Advisors has been relocated to impersonal service centers far from where client’s live; or delegated to a junior professional who may lack the experience to provide qualified advice.

Toll-free contacts have replaced personal cell phone numbers.

But not at Family Office ®.

Family Office ® is dedicated to providing High Touch service that is solidly built upon personal relationships with your family, that lasts from generation to generation.

Our system does not revolve around the widely used service center model.

o the contrary, our client families are encouraged to make their own decisions about the level of personal service they deserve and to demand it of us.

And it is our pleasure to deliver it!

We deliver our personal services through a network of Family Office Advisors&trade; who can assist you with any of your financial needs.  From consolidated bill paying to invenstment advice, trust administration, and sophisticated estate planning, we are on your team.
