How do you explain to someone in the Wealth Management business what Family Office services and “Family Bank” style planning offer as a value added service to clients?

A Family Office is <b>not</b> a Registered Investment Management Firm, who claims to do just wealth management.

Family Office is like having a personal CEO, CFO, CIO and CTO for your family. 

The Family Office coordinates with your wealth management firm, accounting firm, law firm, medical providers, insurance companies, trust companies, and service providers to provide a <b>360 degree</b>, integrated system for your family and its <b>true wealth.</b> 

Family Offices also may provide important concierge services for HNW Families as desired, such as chartered jet services, luxury accommodations around the world, educational consultants, and concierge medical services, security, and risk management specialists, just to name a few.

The “Family Bank” style of “Wealth System Integration” is not an asset management system, but a structural way that the family can maximize all of their Family Wealth Assets (this includes not only the financial, business, and investment assets, but also the way a family may organize and employ their “human capital” and the <b>true wealth</b> of the family. The Family Bank approach provides a flexible answer to risk management and on-going events that erode confidence in building, maintaining, and empowering true Family Wealth.
