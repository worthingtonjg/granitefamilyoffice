We focus on the processes for the selection and monitoring of your Investment Managers. We provide the tools needed you need to frequently evaluate the performance of your many outside advisors and to measure progress toward your financial goals.
				
Granite Family Office ® is not a trust company nor an investment advisory house – we are an independent personal services firm dedicated to your family’s success.

We also draw on our decades of experience to help you select the appropriate specialists for specific purposes when needed.

> By design, we are not investment managers or investment consultants. Rather we are independent. We help you orchestrate the efforts of your trusted accountants, stockbrokers, attorneys, investment managers, life underwriters, real estate specialists and others without being bound to them.
