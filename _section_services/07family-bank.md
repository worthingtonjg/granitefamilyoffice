<p>Our Family Bank速 program is a unique and proprietary program of Granite Family Office速.</p>
				
<p>The Family Bank速 is a sophisticated means by which we help a member family to develop an estate plan for multi-generations within the family. Thanks to some well established tax planning techniques, these plans sometimes eliminate the tax that a family might have to pay when each succeeding generation passes.</p>

<p>For example, a family business will create a family estate. That family estate will be dependent upon a marital trust that passes to a family legacy fund when the parent generation passes. That legacy fund, using capital replacement theory, also creates a family wealth preservation fund that preserves the wealth of the family and provides for their legacy, too. The entire plan is governed by a family committee knowledgeable about the values that created the family wealth in the first place.</p>

<p>This diagram is a simplified example.</p>

<p>Under traditional plans, a family estate, upon the passing of one or both of the parents would incur a pretty significant tax.</p>

<p>However, under the Family Bank速, the family may actually not have to pay <u>any</u> taxes when the parent generation passes. In fact, the family keep the family assets intact and is able to deploy family wealth in far more meaningful ways for generations and encourage a strong connection between wealth and responsibility.</p>

<p>The work Family Bank approach is just about organizing assets in smarter ways empower family goals and to avoid erosion of family assets due to taxes.  It also helps to protect assets in the future from unnecessary legal claims and other problems that can arise. In addition the planning is flexible and grows with the success and maturation of the family.</p>

<p>
    With the federal estate, gift, and generation skipping tax exemption being set at $5.45 million per person in 2016, there are very efficient planning tools that may be used to achieve whatever important goals an individual of family may have. Best of all, once a Family Bank plan is in place, assets are protected from changes in the tax law that may be more onerous than present circumstances provide.
